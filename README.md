# Akita
A browser extension that gives you insight into your involvement with [Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/).

Akita presents your top visited monetized sites, how much time you’re spending on them, and how much you're contributing (or could contribute) to them.

We've built this for the [Grant for the Web x DEV hackathon](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--aIp9TotN--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_500,q_auto,w_1000/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/q19vviykh0oi1s5tkbqe.png)!

## Screenshots & Demos

### Akita Extension Icon
The Akita extension icon changes depending on the site you are visiting. If the site has monetization enabled, then the Akita icon will look something like this:

<img src="assets/demo_mon.svg" alt="Monetization Enabled Akita Icon" height="100px">

Otherwise, if the site does not have monetization enabled, then the icon will appear as:

<img src="assets/demo_unmon.svg" alt="Monetization Not Enabled Akita Icon" height="100px">

### Akita Main View
Our browser extension helps you see the top monetized sites you visit and your involvement with Web Monetization at-a-glance.

Here's a screenshot of what Akita looks like if you're using a Web Monetization provider:

You'll likely have some monetized sites that you visit often, but don't really spend much time on. Maybe you'd like to give them a little more love and spend a bit more time there, so that additional payment can be streamed to them. Check out the 'These monetized sites could use ♥️' section!

Here's a screenshot of what Akita looks like if you don't have a Web Monetization provider installed:

## About Akita

### The Problem We're Addressing

Web Monetization is an exciting new concept! It's paving the way for a more open, fair and inclusive web, to better support both users and creators. But, it's not exactly the easiest concept to understand. It took hours of research and reading before Web Monetization clicked for @elliot and I.

Once we had a grasp of Web Monetization, we realized that the journey to Web Monetization enlightenment was not an easy one. We could see a few major hurdles to overcome along the way:
- **Understanding how it works:** if you don't have technical experience, you aren’t enabled to see the big picture and if you do have technical experience, you may still face a steep learning curve.
- **Being comfortable with what it costs:** putting money into something you don't understand doesn't feel safe and you may not be in a position to put in money anyways.
- **How it relates to you:** it’s not clear how Web Monetization affects the way you interact with websites.

Because of these hurdles, it can be difficult to see the value and broad potential of Web Monetization. We felt like there was a gap - although there’s a good amount of content explaining Web Monetization, we wished there was a free and easy way to _experience_ Web Monetization.

### How Akita Helps

If you’re looking to start supporting websites by streaming payment, Akita will give you a good idea of which sites you can directly support through Web Monetization. If you’re already using a Web Monetization payment provider, Akita gives you insight into your contributions to the website by showing you the time spent on the site and the amount of payment streamed as a result.

As Web Monetization becomes more common on websites, you’ll be able to see the evolution through Akita. We hope to see your favourite sites join the Web Monetization community! All of the data collected about your browsing and streamed payments is stored in local browser storage, so **all of this information stays in your hands**. 

Overall, our goal with Akita is to increase Web Monetization exposure and awareness, and to help people understand how Web Monetization fits in with their regular browsing. We want to give people who aren’t using a Web Monetization provider a way to engage in payment streaming. As more Web Monetization providers pop up, users can choose providers that fit their needs based on the browsing data presented by Akita.

### Why 'Akita'?
Naming projects can be pretty challenging. We spent a good chunk of time coming up with various names before deciding to stay true to our "brand" as _dog-s_ and selecting "Akita" as our project name. 

The Akita is a Japanese dog breed known for its loyalty and dedication. It's also quite fluffy. We were drawn to "Akita" because of the values the breed represents (i.e. loyalty, dedication), as those characteristics are what we want to embrace with our project. Through Akita and Web Monetization, we want to enable mutual loyalty and dedication between content creators/websites and their users.

We were also very inspired by the story of [Hachikō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D) - a dog of immense loyalty. Hachikō was an Akita who would meet with his owner every day at the train station. Even after his owner passed away, Hachikō continued to wait for his owner at the train station for more than 9 years. Hachikō continues to have a legacy in Japanese culture, with various statues created in his memory - there was even an [American film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachi:_A_Dog%27s_Tale) based on him.
