# Akita
A browser extension that gives you insight into your involvement with web monetization.

Akita shows you your top visited sites, how much time you’re spending on them, and whether those sites are monetized or not.

If you’re looking to start supporting websites by streaming payment, Akita will give you a good idea of which sites you can directly support through Web Monetization. If you’re already using a Web Monetization payment provider, Akita gives you insight into your contributions to the website by showing you the time spent on the site and the amount of payment streamed as a result.

As Web Monetization becomes more common on websites, you’ll be able to see the evolution through Akita, as your favourite sites join the Web Monetization community. All of the data collected about the user’s browsing and streamed payments is stored in local browser storage, so all of this information stays in the user’s hands.

Overall, our goal with Akita is to increase Web Monetization exposure and awareness, and to help people understand how Web Monetization fits in with their regular browsing. We want to give people who aren’t using a Web Monetization provider a way to engage in payment streaming. As more Web Monetization providers pop up, users can choose providers that fit their needs based on the browsing data presented by Akita.

## Why 'Akita'?
Naming projects can be pretty challenging. We spent a good chunk of time coming up with various names before deciding to stay true to our "brand" as _dog-s_ and selecting "Akita" as our project name. 

The Akita is a Japanese dog breed known for its loyalty and dedication. It's also quite fluffy. We were drawn to "Akita" because of the values the breed represents, as those characteristics are what we want to embrace with our project. Through Akita and Web Monetization, we want to enable mutual loyalty and dedication between content creators/websites and their users.

We were also very inspired by the story of [Hachikō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D) - a dog of immense loyalty. Hachikō was an Akita who would meet with his owner every day at the train station. Even after his owner passed away, Hachikō continued to wait for his owner at the train station for more than 9 years. Hachikō continues to have a legacy in Japanese culture, with various statues and there was even an [American film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachi:_A_Dog%27s_Tale) based on him.
