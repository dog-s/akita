# Akita License Info

We want to make it easy for anyone to get involved with Akita, so we've licensed our project under two permissive licenses.

We've chosen the MIT License for our software (i.e. code/documentation) and the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC BY 4.0) for any of the assets we create (generally found in [assets](../assets) and any subdirectories).

Licenses can be a bit intimidating, but we've chosen the ones we think make it easiest for you to leverage Akita.

_The short explanations below are meant to make the licenses more understandable and are **not** a substitute for the actual licenses._
