# Akita License Info

We want to make it easy for anyone to get involved with Akita, so we've licensed our project under two permissive licenses.

We've chosen the MIT License for our software (i.e. code/documentation) and the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC BY 4.0) for any of the assets we create (generally found in [assets](../assets) and any subdirectories, other than those found in the [assets/external](../assets/external) directory).

Assets in the [assets/external](../assets/external) directory are assets from another source or repository, which may not have been created by us. Please refer to the per-asset/per-source license information in [assets/external](../assets/external) for more details.

Licenses can be a bit intimidating, but we've chosen the ones we think make it easiest for you to leverage Akita.

_The short explanations below are meant to make the licenses more understandable and are **not** a substitute for the actual licenses._

| Project Component | License | Short Explanation
|:---:|:---:|---|
| Software | [![Software License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) | [Adapted from tl;drLegal:](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license)<br>You can use our software and related<br>documentation as long as you include<br>[our original copyright and license<br>notices](../LICENSE) in any copy of our software<br>or related documentation. |
| Assets | [![Assets License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) | [Adapted from tl;drLegal:](https://tldrlegal.com/license/creative-commons-attribution-4.0-international-(cc-by-4))<br>Distribute, remix, adapt, and build<br>upon our work, as long as you credit<br>us for the original creation, including<br>a URI/hyperlink to our work, [our <br>license and our copyright notice](../LICENSE).|

For our copyright and license notices, please refer to our [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file.

Essentially, just include our [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file and link to this repo if you end up using our code, documentation or assets. :) If you want to use any assets in the [assets/external](../assets/external) directory, you should do a bit more reading on the per-asset/per-source license information, as they likely have different licensing from the rest of our project.
